## 📌 Week 1 Focus
System Overview and Understanding How Biometric Enrollment Works

## 🖥 System Overview

During my first week, I was introduced to the overall biometric system used by the company. The system is designed for identity verification and attendance monitoring using biometric data such as fingerprints and facial recognition.

I learned that the system is composed of:

- Biometric devices (fingerprint, Capture picture, Iris, and Signature)
- Enrollment software
- Database server (SQL Server via SSMS)
- C# desktop application interface
- Network connection between devices and server

The biometric device captures the user’s unique biological data, which is then converted into a digital template and stored securely in the database. The system uses this stored template for future verification.

## 🧠 How Biometric Enrollment Works

I learned that biometric enrollment is the process of registering a new user into the system. The process includes:

1. User information input (Name, ID number, department, etc.)
2. Capturing biometric data (fingerprint or facial scan)
3. Data processing and template generation
4. Saving the biometric template to the SQL database
5. Verifying successful registration

The biometric system does NOT store the actual fingerprint image. Instead, it converts the fingerprint into encrypted mathematical data (biometric template) for security purposes.

If the user is new:
- The system checks if the ID already exists in the database.
- If not, enrollment proceeds.
- If already registered, the system prevents duplicate entries.

## 💻 Technical Learning

During this week, I also observed:

- How C# connects to SQL Server using connection strings
- How SSMS is used to view stored biometric data
- Basic database structure (tables for users and attendance logs)
- How biometric devices communicate over a local network
